It provides recommendations on how you, the applicant, can submit analytical 19 \\nprocedures4 and methods  validation5 data to support the documentation of the identity, strength, 20 \\nquality, purity, and potency of drug substances and drug products.6  It will help you assembl e 21 \\ninformation and present data to support your analytical methodologies.

The principles in this guidance also apply to drug substances 25 \\nand drug products covered in Type II drug master files (DMFs).  26 \\n 27 \\nThis guidance complement s the International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guidance 28 \\nQ2(R1)  Validation of Analytical Procedures:  Text and Methodology  (Q2(R1)) for developing and 29 \\nvalidating analytical methods.    30 \\n 31 \\nThis guidance does not address investigational new drug application ( IND) methods validation, 32 \\nbut s ponsors prepari ng INDs should consider the recommendations in this guidance.  For INDs, 33 \\nsufficient information is required at each phase of an investigation to ensure proper identity, 34 \\nquality, purity, strength, and/or potency.  The amount of information on analytical procedures 35 \\nand methods suitability  will vary with the phase of the investigation.7  For general guidance on 36 \\n                                                           \\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality  in the  Center for Drug Evaluation and \\nResearch (CDER) and the Center for Biologic s Evaluation and Re search (CBER) at the  Food and Drug \\nAdministration.  \\n2 Sample submission is described in s ection IX, FDA M ethods Verification.    \\n3 We update guidances periodicall y.

ANALYTICAL METHODS DE VELOP MENT  96 \\n 97 \\nAn analytical procedure is developed to test  a defined characteristic of the drug substance or 98 \\ndrug product  against  established acceptance criteria for that characteristic.  Early in the 99 \\ndevelopment of a new analytical procedure, the choice of analytical instrumentation and 100 \\nmethodology should be selected based on the intended purpose and scope of the analytical 101 \\nmethod.  Parameters that may be evaluated during method development are specificity, linearity, 102 \\nlimits of detection  (LOD)  and limits of quantitation (LOQ) , range, accuracy, and precision.  103 \\n 104 \\nDuring early stages of method development, t he robustness of methods  should be evaluated 105 \\nbecause th is characteristic can help you decide  which method you will submit for approval .  106 \\nAnalytical procedures in the early stages of development are initially developed based on a 107 \\ncombination of mechanistic understanding of the basic methodology and prior experience.  108 \\nExperimental data from early procedures can be used to guide further development.  You should 109 \\nsubmit development data with in the method validation section if they support the validation of 110 \\nthe method. 111 \\n 112 \\nTo fully understand the effect of changes in method parameters on an analytical procedure, you 113 \\nshoul d adopt a  systematic approach for a method robustne ss study  (e.g., a design of experiments 114 \\nwith method parameters ).  You should begin with an initial risk assessment and follow with 115 \\nmultivariate experiments.  Such approaches allow you to understand factorial parameter effects 116 \\non method performance.  Evalua tion of a  method’ s performance may include analyses of 117 \\nsamples obtained from various stages of the manufacturing process from in -process  to the 118 \\nfinished product.

Applicants should 372 \\nperiodically evaluate the appropriateness of a product’s analytical methods and consider new or 373 \\nalternative methods.  374 \\n 375 \\nIn anticipation of life cycle changes in analytics,  an appropriate number of retention samples 376 \\nshould be maintained  to allow for comparative studies.  The number should be based on 377 \\nscientific principles and an assessment of risk. For complex products that a re sensitive to 378 \\nmanufacturing changes, reserv e samples can be an important tool to make these comparisons.  379 \\n                                                           \\n18 See References section for examples including USP <1010> Analytical Data – Interpretation and Treatment, \\nASTM E1488 Standard Guide for Statistical Procedures to Use in Deve loping and Applying Test Methods and \\nASTM E2782 Standard Guide for Measurement Systems Analysis .

When a change 392 \\nis made to an analytical procedure (e.g., a change in a piece of equipment or reagent or because 393 \\nof a change in manufacturing process or fo rmulation), revalidation of all or part of the analytical 394 \\nprocedure should be considered.

For information on 408 \\nstatistical procedures to use for determining equivalence of two test methods, appropriate 409 \\nliterature  or text should be consulted.19  These scenarios are discussed below.  410 \\n 411 \\n1. Alternative Analytical Procedures  412 \\n 413 \\nAn alternative analytical procedure is an analytical procedure that you use in place of the FDA - 414 \\napproved analytical procedure.  For an NDA or ANDA, you should include any proposed 415 \\nalternate analytical procedures in the application. You must include a description of the 416 \\nprocedure.20  After approval, for an NDA or ANDA, or for a procedure approved in a BLA but 417 \\nnot included in an FDA regulation, the addition, revision, or deletion of an alternative analytical 418 \\nprocedure that provides the same or increased assurance of the identity, strength, quality, purity, 419 \\n                                                           \\n19 See References section for examples including USP General Chapter <1010> Analytical Data –  Interpretation \\nand Treatment and ASTM E2935 Standard Practice for Conducting Equivalence Testing in Laboratory \\nApplications . \\n20 See 21 CFR 314.50.

The principles in this guidance also apply to drug substances 25 \\nand drug products covered in Type II drug master files (DMFs).  26 \\n 27 \\nThis guidance complement s the International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guidance 28 \\nQ2(R1)  Validation of Analytical Procedures:  Text and Methodology  (Q2(R1)) for developing and 29 \\nvalidating analytical methods.    30 \\n 31 \\nThis guidance does not address investigational new drug application ( IND) methods validation, 32 \\nbut s ponsors prepari ng INDs should consider the recommendations in this guidance.  For INDs, 33 \\nsufficient information is required at each phase of an investigation to ensure proper identity, 34 \\nquality, purity, strength, and/or potency.  The amount of information on analytical procedures 35 \\nand methods suitability  will vary with the phase of the investigation.7  For general guidance on 36 \\n                                                           \\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality  in the  Center for Drug Evaluation and \\nResearch (CDER) and the Center for Biologic s Evaluation and Re search (CBER) at the  Food and Drug \\nAdministration.  \\n2 Sample submission is described in s ection IX, FDA M ethods Verification.    \\n3 We update guidances periodicall y.

Early in the 99 \\ndevelopment of a new analytical procedure, the choice of analytical instrumentation and 100 \\nmethodology should be selected based on the intended purpose and scope of the analytical 101 \\nmethod.  Parameters that may be evaluated during method development are specificity, linearity, 102 \\nlimits of detection  (LOD)  and limits of quantitation (LOQ) , range, accuracy, and precision.  103 \\n 104 \\nDuring early stages of method development, t he robustness of methods  should be evaluated 105 \\nbecause th is characteristic can help you decide  which method you will submit for approval .  106 \\nAnalytical procedures in the early stages of development are initially developed based on a 107 \\ncombination of mechanistic understanding of the basic methodology and prior experience.  108 \\nExperimental data from early procedures can be used to guide further development.

You must include a description of the 416 \\nprocedure.20  After approval, for an NDA or ANDA, or for a procedure approved in a BLA but 417 \\nnot included in an FDA regulation, the addition, revision, or deletion of an alternative analytical 418 \\nprocedure that provides the same or increased assurance of the identity, strength, quality, purity, 419 \\n                                                           \\n19 See References section for examples including USP General Chapter <1010> Analytical Data –  Interpretation \\nand Treatment and ASTM E2935 Standard Practice for Conducting Equivalence Testing in Laboratory \\nApplications . \\n20 See 21 CFR 314.50.

The principles in this guidance also apply to drug substances 25 \\nand drug products covered in Type II drug master files (DMFs).  26 \\n 27 \\nThis guidance complement s the International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guidance 28 \\nQ2(R1)  Validation of Analytical Procedures:  Text and Methodology  (Q2(R1)) for developing and 29 \\nvalidating analytical methods.    30 \\n 31 \\nThis guidance does not address investigational new drug application ( IND) methods validation, 32 \\nbut s ponsors prepari ng INDs should consider the recommendations in this guidance.  For INDs, 33 \\nsufficient information is required at each phase of an investigation to ensure proper identity, 34 \\nquality, purity, strength, and/or potency.  The amount of information on analytical procedures 35 \\nand methods suitability  will vary with the phase of the investigation.7  For general guidance on 36 \\n                                                           \\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality  in the  Center for Drug Evaluation and \\nResearch (CDER) and the Center for Biologic s Evaluation and Re search (CBER) at the  Food and Drug \\nAdministration.  \\n2 Sample submission is described in s ection IX, FDA M ethods Verification.    \\n3 We update guidances periodicall y.

ANALYTICAL METHODS DE VELOP MENT  96 \\n 97 \\nAn analytical procedure is developed to test  a defined characteristic of the drug substance or 98 \\ndrug product  against  established acceptance criteria for that characteristic.  Early in the 99 \\ndevelopment of a new analytical procedure, the choice of analytical instrumentation and 100 \\nmethodology should be selected based on the intended purpose and scope of the analytical 101 \\nmethod.  Parameters that may be evaluated during method development are specificity, linearity, 102 \\nlimits of detection  (LOD)  and limits of quantitation (LOQ) , range, accuracy, and precision.  103 \\n 104 \\nDuring early stages of method development, t he robustness of methods  should be evaluated 105 \\nbecause th is characteristic can help you decide  which method you will submit for approval .  106 \\nAnalytical procedures in the early stages of development are initially developed based on a 107 \\ncombination of mechanistic understanding of the basic methodology and prior experience.  108 \\nExperimental data from early procedures can be used to guide further development.  You should 109 \\nsubmit development data with in the method validation section if they support the validation of 110 \\nthe method. 111 \\n 112 \\nTo fully understand the effect of changes in method parameters on an analytical procedure, you 113 \\nshoul d adopt a  systematic approach for a method robustne ss study  (e.g., a design of experiments 114 \\nwith method parameters ).  You should begin with an initial risk assessment and follow with 115 \\nmultivariate experiments.  Such approaches allow you to understand factorial parameter effects 116 \\non method performance.  Evalua tion of a  method’ s performance may include analyses of 117 \\nsamples obtained from various stages of the manufacturing process from in -process  to the 118 \\nfinished product.

Analytical Methods Transfer Studies  465 \\n 466 \\nAnalytical method transfer is typically managed under a  transfer protocol that details the 467 \\nparameters to be evaluated in addition to the predetermined acceptance criteria that will be 468 \\napplied to the results.  Transfer studies usually involve two or more laboratories or sites 469 \\n(originating lab and receiving labs) executing the preapproved transfer protocol.  A sufficient 470 \\nnumber of representative test articles (e.g., same lot(s) of drug substance or drug product) are 471 \\nused by the originating a nd receiving laboratories.  The comparative studies are performed to 472 \\nevaluate accuracy and precision, especially with regard to assessment of interlaboratory 473 \\nvariability.  In cases where the transferred analytical procedure is also a stability -indicating 474 \\nmethod, forced degradation samples or samples containing pertinent product -related impurities 475 \\nshould be analyzed at both sites.
